> [[caveat-lector|CAVEAT LECTOR]]: This is a daily note! Sometimes they'll be structured, sometimes they won't. These are more for the benefit of my near- and long-term future self, but I do tend to publish them in case they're somehow helpful for other people.

## Today's Plan

Back to the work week! We haven't had sprint planning, yet, so I'm not totally sure what today/this week has in store quite yet - I'll loop back around and update blocks once I have 'em.

## Today's Report

> To have the full intended experience, please listen to the [Pikmin 2 "Today's Report" theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCmKZnq3U&list=PLwyW5mbdZMGN8mGTqvDhsBs37SW4TkHcw&index=85) while reading & writing this

So, this particular report goes... well into tomorrow. I've been doing pretty good on my [[season-of-rhythm|sleep rhythm]] lately, so let's consider this 6:00AM posting a bit of a relapse.

I need to get... a couple hours of sleep before I need to be up in the morning, especially considering it's my partners birthday(!), so this'll be a brief EOD. I will personally blame whoever it is that made [this amazing set of proxmox LXC setup scripts](https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/) for stealing my sleep tonight, in order to properly divert blame away from the true culprit: myself.
