> - **[[2024-03-15#A-Block|Afternoon Block]]**: Afternoon work session - usually the bulk of work. 12pm - 5pm

### M-Block

#### NUnit Discord Logger

- **PLAN:** 
	- Create ASP.NET general service to collect & batch logs
	- Create `ITrace` for use in NUnit tests
	- Implement on test server webhook - once confirmed, move over to core server
- **DELIVERABLES:**
	- A message (locally) posted from NUnit to Discord
	- Stretch goal is a webhook configuration able to create a new thread in a Forum channel

### A-Block

#### Backstage Local Run

As dayjob work starts shuffling up a bit more, I want to elbow for a bit of room to keep working on Backstage plugins. To do that, I need to get my local Backstage build back up-and-running - and probably *updated* as well, since god knows how long it has been since I got that running 😬

- **PLAN:** 
	1. Redownload Backstage as a fresh repo
	2. Possible minor configuration - I'll likely test this on the CGC GitHub repository so I have the admin access needed to generate keys & pull information
	3. Taking a closer (more organized) look at the run scopes in the repo
- **DELIVERABLES:** 
	1. Docker Compose-able Backstage running locally for plugin development. hype hype hype! 🎉

#### Shop Excerpt Written

Today may be a dayjob early-release day, in which case I *really* need to get [[shop-highlight-note|the Shop Highlight excerpt]] written & sent.

- **PLAN:** 
	1. Take a look at the notes I took last week
	2. Jot down draft, run it through something to un-fuck my fucked writing style.
- **DELIVERABLES:** 
	1. Deliver as formatted email w/ Markdown attachment. God bless Markdown - hopefully this time doesn't end up like [[digital-gardening-with-quartz#^1bc4a7|the last guest post I wrote]] 😬
	
### E-Block

#### Eco Server Run

The friends have settled on eco!! I believe I got most of this taken care of last night, but may need to adjust server run parameters. This'll be the first stress test of the Allytron's game container, so I don't totally know what the resource req will look like.

- **PLAN:** 
	1. Rally the lads!
	2. Monitor specs during run
	3. OPTIONAL: bully my partner into joining us
- **DELIVERABLES:** 
	1. Fun, enjoyment, social satisfaction, etc. etc.

## Today's Report

> To have the full intended experience, please listen to the [Pikmin 2 "Today's Report" theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCmKZnq3U&list=PLwyW5mbdZMGN8mGTqvDhsBs37SW4TkHcw&index=85) while reading

- **LUNCH UPDATE:** Did some TLC to the layout of the daily notes. Added yesterday/tomorrow links to the top of each page (Formatting definitely required - tempted to just handle this in the standard quartz post emitter, now that I know how to do that) and configured the Daily Notes appender in the [Raycast Quartz Plugin](https://raycast.com/KevinBatdorf/obsidian) to append some custom logic for auto-incrementing footnotes. Not perfect, but works a treat.
  
  Also did an update for a new layout for per-block tasks in the daily notes. I feel like I've been having trouble measuring tasks on a micro-level, and decided to use the same format for dayjob work that I do for contracting work, with a scope, plan, & declared set of deliverables so I can very confidently say that I did (or did not) finish something, and call the shot to stay on track & be intentional with my time.
  
  I'm considering setting up a Sunday-specific weekly template, so that I can better plan out my weeks during Sunday CGC work.
