> [[caveat-lector|CAVEAT LECTOR]]: This is a daily note! Sometimes they'll be structured, sometimes they won't. These are more for the benefit of my near- and long-term future self, but I do tend to publish them in case they're somehow helpful for other people.

## Today's Plan

I didn't plan anything today, but I do want to start planning things in the future.

## Today's Report

I'm totally ripping off the labelling of this from [Pikmin 2's "Today's Report" screen](https://www.pikminwiki.com/Day_results_menu).

That's not even a joke - I absolutely love the idea of ending the day with little graphs of what I did (or did not do) well that day in a tidy little reflective at-a-glance view.

Today was (and will continue to be - my plan is to go home and keep going while I watch Avatar) a whole lot of writing. I'm still in the process of [[digital-gardening-with-quartz|creating a new blog with Quartz]], but I keep catching myself falling into a trap of "I want to make everything look perfect before I publish it!". Despite spending the day jotting down my thoughts about [[over-under-engineering|over-engineering killing my dreams]], I can't seem to stop myself.

The stopping point for today will probably be a vague "do I feel like I've written enough to cover, at a base level, the anchor tags of what I want to write." I still *do* want to do some weird `D3.js` fuckery to Quartz's network graph where major "anchor" tags are locked to the outside of a circle (or some other shape) with extending graphs moving inward, but I am unfortunately blocked by [not knowing how to debug with Quartz's weird custom CLI build process](https://discord.com/channels/927628110009098281/1211416332403482714/1211416332403482714).

Actually, it looks like the Quartz author just got back to me - [QuartzComponents are built...](https://discord.com/channels/927628110009098281/1211416332403482714/1211479335429734531) ^43b351

too late? too early? I still don't know enough about frontend development to fully understand [how Quartz works under-the-hood](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/advanced/architecture) or totally what that message means.

TL;DR something about the Quartz build process means that I can't use DevTools in a browser to debug Quartz components. Yesterday I was researching CodePens (or, more specifically, VSCode-inline [CodeSwings](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codespaces-Contrib.codeswing)) as a better workflow for my not-design-or-frontend-savvy self to develop these components in isolation. While I do still want to do some deep customizations to the way the Quartz `Graph` component works, I have decided (just now, as I'm writing) to leave this as a stretch goal, and instead prioritize getting this blog out as-is and customizing it to my liking later.

More work to be done in the endless struggle to avoid putting horses before carts, or whatever.
