> [[caveat-lector|CAVEAT LECTOR]]: This is a daily note! Sometimes they'll be structured, sometimes they won't. These are more for the benefit of my near- and long-term future self, but I do tend to publish them in case they're somehow helpful for other people.

## Today's Plan

I think today is likely going to be lighter day, likely finishing up assigned work during the B-block - I have a couple last-minute touches to an internal MVP, but not sure to what extent my time is booked up for the rest of the day. May take M-block to do a bit of light research on [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) plugins.

### B-Block

-  Quick horticulture on (free) C# code coverage libraries

### M-Block

- Backstage horticulture

### E-Block

- Resume review - for real, this time!!
- Actions/Quartz deployment

## Notes

- https://www.hanselman.com/blog/altcover-and-reportgenerator-give-amazing-code-coverage-on-net-core - Free code coverage for C#. Uncertain about Rider compat >:l

- https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/ - Study on Pull Request ideal review size. I have no idea how big PRs should be and it falls into the same "economic value of lines of code" issue that I've looked at before. There's lots of metrics - lines changed? files changed" feature count? subfeature count?
- https://smallbusinessprogramming.com/optimal-pull-request-size/ - More research resources I need to take a look at. Someday I will have an opinion.
