> [[caveat-lector|CAVEAT LECTOR]]: This is a daily note! Sometimes they'll be structured, sometimes they won't. These are more for the benefit of my near- and long-term future self, but I do tend to publish them in case they're somehow helpful for other people.

## Today's Plan

I think today's plan has me diving back into the wonderful world of DevOps, testing out internal DNS capabilities for development resources within VPCs. Thankfully [[2024-03-04|doing a bunch of personal Tailscale/server bullshit]] the other day has gotten me in a [Domain Name State of Mind](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=LnGMcxWmtRA&si=rEsA29xSyvQ7-Ybg).

I think E-block today is going to be fixing up the homelab server. I took apart all of the pieces to clean them but (from what my partner has told me -- oops!) there's a fan in there that isn't balanced and constantly clicking, so it'll be some investigating there.

Also excited to put in a couple extra pieces - I bought a cheap burner card (GTX 1030 for like $60) to dedicate to video encoding/decoding, along with a few other here-and-there parts to expand storage slots. So long, 256GB storage!

### B-Block

- Starting on internal AWS DNS module for [Account Factory Terraform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/aft-getting-started.html)
- While I'm in DevOps land, I kinda want to take, like, 30 minutes and follow up on a weird concept I read about awhile back - [unit testing Terraform code](https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-test). I don't totally understand how one would unit test... infrastructure configurations? but who knows, maybe it'll blow my mind

### M-Block

- Meeting up with our PM to talk over some developer experience stuff - people problems are truly the hardest engineering problems

### E-Block

- N/A - I'm hanging out with my partner tonight, but depending on how long her plague-ridden body can handle doing things, I may do some hardware stuff tonight on the homelab server.

## Notes

- I'd like to eventually make the viz from the [[utah-office-consult|utah consult post]] a follow-up to the [[supply-chain|supply chain network post]] as an intro to [that one guy on bluesky's network graph viz guide](https://elijahmeeks.com/networkviz/)
