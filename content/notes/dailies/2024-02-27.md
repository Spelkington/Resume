> [[caveat-lector|CAVEAT LECTOR]]: This is a daily note! Sometimes they'll be structured, sometimes they won't. These are more for the benefit of my near- and long-term future self, but I do tend to publish them in case they're somehow helpful for other people.

## Today's Plan

I didn't get nearly as much C# done as I'd wanted to yesterday - while I'm a bit hesitant to say that "today is going to be a 100% effort day!", considering [[2024-02-26#Today's Report|how yesterday ended]] I've kept C# goals to a breezy middle-of-the-road, since I'd rather under- than over-set expectations.

### B-Block

-  More [ChainSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Theauxm.ChainSharp#readme-body-tab) step testing.
	- As an aside, I think I've been dramatically over-complicating how I create separable PRs. This is one of my "Fuck, Theaux was right" moments that I increasingly have as I learn more C#. At some point, I'd like to do some gardening on philosophies for separable pull requests and commits.
### M-Block

- Checking on our internal project status - there's likely tasks I can pick up, but my current work is the only very-large-web I have left to untangle (unless I'm forgetting something, which is likely.)

### E-Block

- Today's E-block is a CGC day, so (sleep status pending) I'd like to work on actually taking what I have and uploading it to GitHub. This'll mean taking a look at the Quartz build process.
	- Another aside - while I appreciate how much the developers of Quartz has made it user-friendly with a custom CLI, it abstracts away some of the usual development workflow and means I have to learn (and consequently fumble around with) a new thing. That said, I also don't know jack shit about frontend development and there's probably a good reason for that.
- Oh, what's this?? A friend of mine asked me to take a look over his resume. He's still using [[resume-ci-pipeline|the old LaTeX version of my resume template]], so I'm real excited to get him moved over to the new Typst version (post pending). CGC blog stuff may get pushed back accordingly - not sure how high-capacity I'm feeling now at 5pm
