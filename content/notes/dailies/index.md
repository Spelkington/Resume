title: Daily Notes
---
These are daily notes, where I log and track progress on ongoing projects and make notes for myself later. These are largely for my own benefit, and are here in case they're helpful to myself (or, somehow, others) in the future.

However, I'd describe these as *loose*, at *best*. [[caveat-lector|Caveat lector.]]

One of the approaches to [[digital-gardening-with-quartz|digital gardening]] is "learning in public" - to that end, I plan on continuing to outwardly publish these.
