### Morning Block

N/A
### Afternoon Block

#### Discord Logging

Just to start the work week on a fresh note, I'm going to wrap up the Discord forum logging before anything else today.

- **PLAN:** 
	1. Test hooks manually onto a forum channel in a test server
	2. Transfer customizations over to a configuration file
	3. Insert the head commit hash for splitting threads by deployment
- **DELIVERABLES:** 
	1. Threaded, batched logs, output to the test server forum channel

### Evening Block

#### Quartz Index Testing

While [[2024-03-10#Today's Report|the current landing page]] isn't particularly bad, it isn't *good* either. I'd like to do some touch-ups, with inspiration from a couple of examples of quartz that have customized their sites to a greater degree.

- **PLAN:** 
	1. There's a particular Quartz site I saw that had a fantastic implementation of a landing page - I'll need to find that
	2. Review the code for their emitter (provided it's open-source ‚Äî fingers crossed ü§û)
- **DELIVERABLES:** 
	1. If feeling spicy, possibly give implementation a try.
