> [[caveat-lector|CAVEAT LECTOR]]: This is a daily note! Sometimes they'll be structured, sometimes they won't. These are more for the benefit of my near- and long-term future self, but I do tend to publish them in case they're somehow helpful for other people.

## Today's Plan

Today is a bit strange - I'm currently on a kick of only gaming with friends (gaming solo, for whatever reason, has started to feel like "wasting time" (which is totally not a statement on the virtue of solo gaming, this is just how I feel about it at the moment)). After [a bit of a misadventure](https://bsky.app/profile/spencer.chaoticgood.computer/post/3kljmrvqd2u2q) trying to [[warning-about-slabtops|turn an old laptop into a well-ventilated server]], a friend's brother *very* graciously offered me some spare PC parts he had lying around so I could (properly, this time) start a home lab for running miscellaneous things, such as dedicated multiplayer servers at my home.

I highly doubt any CGC work will get done today - I'd vastly prefer setting up the server and playing around with some homelab setup experimentation.
