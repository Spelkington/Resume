> [[caveat-lector|CAVEAT LECTOR]]: This is a daily note! Sometimes they'll be structured, sometimes they won't. These are more for the benefit of my near- and long-term future self, but I do tend to publish them in case they're somehow helpful for other people.

## Today's Plan

Most of today's plan is going to be getting an internal NWYC project up-and-running with an MVP before we transition to some compliance updates to infrastructure. Follow-up on CGC will be taking inventory of the writing I did yesterday, and (once again) debating whether or not to get the formatting of the blog *just right* before I publish.

### B-Block

- Completing C# wrappers for Geocoding services
- Working on next [ChainSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Theauxm.ChainSharp#readme-body-tab) steps for congressional data lookups

### M-Block

- Likely a continuation of B-block work

### E-Block

- CGC; in particular, *either*
	- Continuing content writing, potentially starting the new posts for 1099 contractor writing; OR
	- Setting up an environment & workflow for creating swings with [[2024-02-25|CodeSwings]]
- Stretch goal is contemplating whether or not MDX compatibility for Obsidian and Quartz will come now or later. I think Remark has the ability to do MDX files but I'll need to spike that a bit more closely.

## Today's Report

- **Noon progress update:** Got distracted at the possibilities of AWS CloudWatch Dashboards. Morning block is a bit behind, but getting back to it.
- **Afternoon progress update**: as a general rule, try to never fuck up the same way twice. that's a good motivation for writing down as much as possible *outside* of code, so that the body of DX-related issues with undocumented fixes is always shrinking.
  
  ðŸŽµ come with me ðŸŽµ //
  ðŸŽµ and you'll see ðŸŽµ //
  ðŸŽµ a world in which *no* developer fucks up the same way twice, and rather fucks up in new and creative ways each time ðŸŒˆ ðŸŽµ

In sum total, today was... *okay?* *ish?* in terms of progress. Didn't quite get as far as I'd hoped on C#, but some other (equally important) stuff came up and that seems okay. E-block certainly didn't go as far as I'd hoped (read: it did not happen) but at least CGC stuff is at my own pace.

Admittedly, a [minor distraction](https://bsky.app/profile/spencer.chaoticgood.computer/post/3kmebnpcb322w) did pull away more of my attention than I ought to've allowed.

As a bit of a buzzer-beater against my self-imposed daily deadline of 12:00pm MT, I've decided to just publish this new blog format as-is. It doesn't quite have the same style and zest as the original, but I'd rather put this out to encourage myself to improve it rather than let it languish in a "refactor" branch on GitHub.

**UPDATE:** I did not beat the buzzer. It is currently 4:00AM the next day, and I am *definitely* not going to be deploying anything. Ironically, during this time I wrote the first posts about [[the-quest-to-slay-the-gremlin|slaying The Gremlin]] and [[season-of-rhythm|my Year of Rhythm]], which is ironic considering The Gremlin certainly won tonight.
