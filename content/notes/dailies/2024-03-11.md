> [[caveat-lector|CAVEAT LECTOR]]: This is a daily note! Sometimes they'll be structured, sometimes they won't. These are more for the benefit of my near- and long-term future self, but I do tend to publish them in case they're somehow helpful for other people.

## Today's Plan

Jesus. I think I'm officially Oldâ„¢ now. Daylight Savings was last night and [I legitimately feel hung over right now](https://youtu.be/4GUzYFTDTio?si=0hGDlHJUZrKJdJJE&t=21).
### B-Block

- Terraform infrastructure - taking a look at the glories of DNS handling
- Doing brief & sexy horticulture on terraform unit testing

### M-Block

- I am too tired to look more than about ten minutes into the future.

### E-Block

- Going home to assemble a bedside table and take a nap. God, I need a nap.
- Laundry Party!
