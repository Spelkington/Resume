> [[caveat-lector|CAVEAT LECTOR]]: This is a daily note! Sometimes they'll be structured, sometimes they won't. These are more for the benefit of my near- and long-term future self, but I do tend to publish them in case they're somehow helpful for other people.

## Today's Plan

Whoops! Fell asleep at a reasonable hour [[2024-02-27|yesterday]], and didn't get jack squat from my E-block done. That said, considering the [[2024-02-26|day before]], the sleep was very welcome. And - not to break my arm patting myself on the back - I **did** say that everything in that block was tentative.

Today is pretty much the same thing as yesterday - [ChainSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Theauxm.ChainSharp#readme-body-tab) does set things up in such a way that most work is "Today, I make another Step!" and that, plus not giving too many details for private projects, means that the B- and E-blocks for *probably* the rest of this week are not going to be *too* spicy and different.

### B-Block

-  Working on ChainSharp steps for private project

### M-Block

- Working on ChainSharp step tests for private project

### E-Block

- This... we'll see. Today isn't *technically* a CGC day - those tend to be Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, yesterday was less than productive, so depending on my partner's schedule (she may be going climbing) I'll probably be staying in the office a bit later for CGC.
- **If CGC work happens today**, current priority list (I should store these on an actual list app) is:
	- Resume reviews - 3 pending for two students and a friend
	- Quartz deployment to GitHub Pages
	- Quartz customization - likely a custom index page

## Today's Report

- **8PM Update:** Hmmm... I think I'm going to pivot off of resumes. For an internal project, it'll be in my best interest to get a bit of progress down on graph analysis & generation in TypeScript. I've already wasted (ironically) enough CGC time today on [[putting-selfcontrol-on-raycast|creating a SelfControl extension for RayCast]]. I think the reviews can wait until this weekend - likely Sunday, but I'll try to get those done before then based on âœ¨ vibes ðŸŒˆ.
  
  Ideally, I'd like to have a Jupyter-ish environment to prototype frontend - likely, this means picking up where I left off [[2024-02-25#Today's Report|the other day]] with CodeSwings, and doing some horticulture on [the TypeScript analog to Python's Pandas/C#'s LINQ, Data Forge](https://github.com/data-forge/data-forge-ts).

...

Okay - so *technically* I did *most* of what I set out to do today. Left myself a bit of wiggle room on the E-block. Again. If you squint your eyes and tilt your head, foresight and unreliability do look *quite* similar.

I have decided I'm very excited about the SelfControl on Raycast stuff. Of all the things that rattle around in my skull, the [xkcd post about time saved vs time spent automating](https://xkcd.com/1205/) is the most rattle-y. After mulling it over (while i was doing it, which is the perfect time to second-guess yourself) I decided the juice was worth the squeeze if it means I can more reliably pull myself out of doomscrolls and death spirals.

When it comes to the art of [[gremlin-kicking]], I do think that [[raycast-review|Raycast]] is the greatest set of steel-toed boots I own. It's not the worst thing in the world that they now have a bit more weight in the heel with SelfControl tacked on.

I will, however, also admit that - in terms of deliverables - the squeeze also squoze(?) out some time for other things I was hoping to do today. Hopefully trimming the doomscrolling fat makes up the time soon. Other than that slight detour, my CGC priorities remain *generally* the same and some of today's list will likely get recycled into Friday. Tomorrow will be a lighter report day - CGC work is taking a backseat to watching the new(ish) Mean Girls with my partner, and then likely cleansing our palettes with the original Mean Girls afterwards. Taking a backseat? *Classic* Regina.

In a buzzer-beater, I learned a bit about D3 and finally settled on [how to use CodeSwings in such a way that I can have them interact with Quartz internals](https://github.com/Spelkington/spelkington.github.io/blob/442527d710b6038ffed9acd24f6ad1877ada9b83/swings/2024-02-28%20(11-25-55%20PM)/App.tsx#L1-L10). Maybe I *am* a frontend guy?? ðŸ˜Ž

(i am not.)

## Notes

- https://github.blog/2024-02-28-how-were-using-github-projects-to-standardize-our-workflows-and-stay-aligned/ - perhaps Projects is actually becoming... good? What a time to be alive!
- https://www.rawgraphs.io/ - Implementation as Backstage Plugin or Electron App?
- https://github.com/rawgraphs/rawgraphs-app - unfortunately not the type of "app" i was hoping for.
- https://github.com/jessejanderson/skylink - would be nice to do a popup as an Arc boost
- https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/c524392d80b35348811bae59831f29bfdbc34432/extensions/youtube-music/ - I'd like to, at some point, look at forking & adding the ability to add a song to a playlist. the selfcontrol stuff was quite a gateway drug, although i'll have to adapt to using TypeScript for extensions rather than creating shitty, poorly-tested bash.
