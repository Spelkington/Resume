Digital economies are primarily-online economies that you might find in multiplayer games, network and cloud resource optimizations, or other digital spaces where you'd find a whole lot of chaos and complications. Digital economies are interesting - to me, at least - because the digital medium they behave in offer incredible opportunities for creating, researching & understanding [[stability-of-marriage|market designs]], enforced by digital systems, that you may not find in the real world.

Despite being digital, they are very, *very* real.
