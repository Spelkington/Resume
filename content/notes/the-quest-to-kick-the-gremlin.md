I am terrified by how quickly, without structure and habits, my life devolves into a cycle of sleeping, eating, procrastinating, and repeating until the visage of death sweeps me from this mortal coil.

This cycle is called **"The Gremlin"**

I hate The Gremlin. The Gremlin makes me sad. The Gremlin stops me from doing the things that make me happy. Every day, I have to actively re-remember how much I hate The Gremlin, and how much happier I am when it's gone, so I try my best to kick The Gremlin.

I *also* hate the word "productivity." There's a sort of LinkedIn-centric slice of society that has built up the neutrality as an honest days' work as a divinely-capitalized entity: Productivity™. It elicits (in me, personally) the visceral feeling I get when I see hustle-culture, rise-and-grind, success-is-a-choice-and-failure-is-your-fault types - the ones that farm for engagement by repeating gross approximations of quotes from self-help books that have been Human Centipede'd from one hustler to another.

*That being said* - productivity tools are some of my most reliable Gremlin-kicking weapons. This leaves me feeling very conflicted. Absent the weird Soylent-chugging culture that has formed around capital-P Productivity™, I would be in (and have been to) a *really* rough place without the productivity tools and habits I've tried my best to use and form in my quest to kick The Gremlin.

As a transparent act of shoving this internal inconsistency into the box in the back of my skull labelled "Don't Think About It!", I'll be using the [[gremlin-kicking]] tag to denote posts about productivity and productivity tools.

In these posts, I'll talk a bit about the structures I put up in my own life, and the tools I use to enforce those structures. To some degree, [[gremlin-kicking]] posts exist because I hope it might help another person who has their own Gremlin to kick and is looking for new tools to kick it. To a far greater degree, they're here because the act of writing it down helps me set these structures in stone for myself. It is surprisingly easy to forget about good habits when, some day in the future, they're no longer the habits they used to be.

[[caveat-lector|Caveat lector]] - *you are you, and I am me.* Some of these posts may resonate with you, and some of them may not, because different people are different.
