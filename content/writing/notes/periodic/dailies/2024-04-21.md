## Today's Plan

*Yeesh*. Starting the day halfway through - just got back from a drag brunch and I feel like somebody has activated noise cancelling on my literal ear drums.

Main thing today is to chew through some smaller things that have been building up. No formal task blocks today — if time permits, I'll take a look at the CGC Backstage.

### [[cgc-backstage]]

- [x] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-backstage Re-instantiated template on `#latest` - fresh push to repo  [completion:: 2024-04-21]
- [ ] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-backstage 
- [ ] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-backstage Operational build hosted on Allytron
- [ ] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-backstage GitHub CGC Organization Data Pull
- [ ] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-backstage GitHub CGC Organization Authentication. It'll be just me, for right now — *oh, so lonely*

### [[cgc-misc]]

- [I] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-misc At some point, I would like to do an #annotations project on management research on transitioning from a small- to medium-sized business. I have, in passing, *heard* about Executive MBA classes dedicated entirely to this subject, but have never read the research myself.
