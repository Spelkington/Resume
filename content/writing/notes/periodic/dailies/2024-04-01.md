## Today's Plan

Alright! After a holiday weekend (truly) off, I'm getting back in the swing of things this week! The broad-strokes agenda:

- [ ] Write up documentation for Friday's super fun (apparently top sneaky) project & proofread
- [ ] Get started on some Fastmatrix horticulture.
- [ ] For CGC, I have some clerical work to do - in particular, organizing tax documents (riveting!), getting back to a handful of research emails
- [ ] As a treat for the evening, there's either a) an analytics project or b) continuing Gatsby rewrite work. We'll see how the afternoon goes!
