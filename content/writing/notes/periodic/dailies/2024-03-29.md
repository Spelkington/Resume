## Today's Plan

Alright - cobbling together my rhythm again. For today - most of my team is out either sick, or for the eclipse running through Texas soon (ah, yes — the classic "eclipse day".) My boss told me to "either take the day off or work on something fun," so I think I'll be opting for the "something fun."

There's a few side projects that I could pull off the shelf. One of them involves a few things I've been wanting to look at; namely:

a) Rapid Prototyping
b) C#/TypeScript interactivity
c) Encryption & security standards

We'll see how it goes! I've been looking at trying a faster workflow. One thing I've noticed (and lamented) about C# is how much *fucking* boilerplate there tends to be on ASP.NET project. It makes prototyping *incredibly* slow compared to, say, TypeScript and Python. I'm hoping to get around that for this project and, if all goes well, have a prototype for it by before the end of the day and pop off a bit early for some CGC work I'm *disastrously* behind on.

## Today's Report

Whew! Today's project went *great*, with a few particular highlights

- In the process of trying to make this quick & painless, I've gotten *way* more comfortable with setting up Yarn monorepos for multi-language projects - this one in particular was a quick React/TS frontend and ASP.NET backend and... it works great! It does feel a bit odd to make a near-empty `project.json` and just remap a bunch of native `dotnet` commands to instead go through `yarn`, but *very* exciting
- I cannot emphasize enough how much heavy lifting Copilot did on the frontend. In general, I know *just* enough about Typescript and web development to be indisputably bad at it. However, the nice thing is that, in a case where you know core concepts but not notation, Copilot can help bridge the gap.
  
  The more I work professionally as an engineer, the more I come to accept that being able to read code is likely more important than being able to write it — and in this era, the gap seems to be widening.
- Okay - I rail on C# for being very boiler-plate-y, but — admittedly — starting with just a bare ASP.NET starter was *incredibly* refreshing.

Between this and getting GitHub Actions to run, generally, locally on computers — that's two *huge* wins for this week. Ending the week on this note is *super* satisfying. Provided the holiday weekend, I think I'll be taking both days off this weekend. We'll pick back up on Monday! 🎉
