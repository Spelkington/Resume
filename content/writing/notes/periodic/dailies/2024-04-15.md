## Today's Plan

Alright - I'd like to hit the ground running this week so I can take next week easy, possibly with a long weekend.

As an aside - if this projects system works out, I may want to try retroactively applying these to earlier daily notes.

### [[fastlane-demo]]

- [ ] #task #projects/dayjob/fastlane-demo Finish setting up local instances of Android Studio & Xcode. It's days like this that make me glad I'm not usually in the mobile app development business.
    - [x] #task #projects/dayjob/fastlane-demo I'm going to have to fetch a shitload of developer certificates and keys from both the Apple and Google stores. Yeesh. Recording here for a process doc  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
    - [x] #task #projects/dayjob/fastlane-demo **iOS**  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
        - [x] #task #projects/dayjob/fastlane-demo Create app, developer profile, certificate from Apple  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
        - [x] #task #projects/dayjob/fastlane-demo Create calendar entries for key/cert expiration dates  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
    - [x] #task #projects/dayjob/fastlane-demo **ANDROID**  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
        - [x] #task #projects/dayjob/fastlane-demo AMEND: Install [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/)(?) instead of Java 17, as encryption library is required for [android signing keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76516045/cannot-find-any-provider-supporting-rsa-none-oaepwithsha1andmgf1padding-when-t)  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
        - [x] #task #projects/dayjob/fastlane-demo *Manually* create keystore using play's keysign `jar`/java  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
    - It looks like there's a *lot* of setup to go before either of these are upload-able, including the initial seed build on Google Play so that the application can get a default bundle name. Yuck.

### [[tags/projects/misc]]

- [ ] #task #projects/misc Before I leave the office, sending out that highlight note.
- [x] #task #projects/misc When I take out the bins after work today, I should take a bit of time to de-clutter Karmala while they're front and center.  [completion:: 2024-04-17]
- [x] #task #projects/misc Laundry party. I'm quickly running out of pants.  [completion:: 2024-04-17]
- [ ] #task #projects/misc If I'm feeling real spicy, there's a couple pairs of pants I need to iron & sew cuffs into.
- [x] #task #projects/misc I've got a dinner to go to this evening as an ‚ú® esteemed and accomplished alumni üåà of the University of Utah ‚Äî I think there's some kind of panel going on. i am very excited to [impart some sage wisdom on the local youths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZFgxalnsmE)  [completion:: 2024-04-15]

### [[cgc-gatsby-template]]

- [x] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-gatsby-template Finish periodic notes setup such that:  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
    - [x] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-gatsby-template Seasonal entries (e.g. [[rhythm|the Season of Rhythm]]) are set as a "soft" quarterly entry  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
    - [x] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-gatsby-template Weekly & Daily entries are titled based on the current season  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
    - [x] #task #projects/cgc/cgc-gatsby-template Weekly & Daily entries get tagged based on the current season  [completion:: 2024-04-15]
    - This should be active tomorrow - very excited!

## Today's Report

> To have the full intended experience, please listen to the [Pikmin 2 "Today's Report" theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1fCmKZnq3U&list=PLwyW5mbdZMGN8mGTqvDhsBs37SW4TkHcw&index=85) while reading

Well... I *did* say that [[obsidian-tasks-workflow#Hindsight|the new tasks workflow would be a good measurement for overestimating how much I can do in a day]]. That seems to've been proven correct - the task plans for the fastlane demo have taken longer than expected. It's interesting ‚Äî there's just a *lot* cookin' on automated app deployments that I hadn't considered. In particular, I've noticed how many options there are during app store deployments (both iOS and Android) that are, under normal circumstances, handled by the stores or IDEs themselves ‚Äî certs, keys, etc. etc. Unfortunately, that luxury doesn't seem to exist when automating everything yourself.

I am very excited, though, to more tightly integrate seasonal themes into the day-to-day. While I wasn't writing every day for the past few weeks, I (thankfully, for my own sanity) did keep up a pretty good rhythm ‚Äî with some notable periods of exception, but hey, it's all in progress.
