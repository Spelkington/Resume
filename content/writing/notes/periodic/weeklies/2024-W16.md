## Up & Coming

Okay! After an incredibly strong start today, I'm feeling ready to tackle an amalgamation of small things that I need to take care of. With the introduction of project pages and universal task management, I can now handle consolidating tasks for a given project across the entire Obsidian vault - particularly (and, most exciting-ly) the daily notes where I spend most of my time.

### Projects

- #projects/dayjob/fastlane-demo
- #projects/cgc/cgc-gatsby-template
- #projects/personal/tweedin-in-sweden

## Tasks

### Due

```dataview
TASK
WHERE !completed
  AND typeof(due) = "date"
  AND due <= date("2024-04-14") + dur(7 days)
SORT date ASC
GROUP BY file.link
```

### Done

```dataview
TASK
WHERE typeof(completion) = "date"
  AND completion >= date("2024-04-14")
  AND completion < date("2024-04-14") + dur(7 days)
SORT date DESC
LIMIT 5
GROUP BY file.link
```
