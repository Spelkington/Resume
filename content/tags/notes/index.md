title: Spencer's Notes
---
These are notes - they're things that are structured, albeit not necessarily as structured or refined as [[articles|CGC articles]].

In general, there are three kinds of notes I make:

- General notes, which are found on this page
- [[tags/notes/daily|Daily Notes]], which contain daily logs for my own benefit
- [[tags/notes/scratch|Scratch Notes]], which really just means "none of the above"
