## Overview

I've been on a rampage trying to eliminate the need to use the mouse (oh, to become a true [never-mouse-er](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJF2VT-ymjM)). Because MacOS spaces are... less than stellar to that end, I'm working on setting up [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) for this.

I've already made some headway on this, using everything in conjunction with Hyperkey to set up navigation keys for workspaces: in particular:

- The ability to move between workspaces using `Hyper+H and L`
- The ability to move between panes using `Hyper+J and K`
- The ability to move panes between workspaces using `Hyper+1, 2, ...`

There are some additional odds-and-ends that I'd like to add on.

## Deliverables

1. Aerospace for basic tasks (moving, opening, closing windows)
2. Basic filter list for apps that [should be dialogs, but aren't](https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide#dialog-heuristics)
3. New personal configuration setup for macOS
