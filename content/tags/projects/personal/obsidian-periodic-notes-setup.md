## Overview

To keep better track of my weeks and give a bit more of a constant trajectory, I'm setting up the [Obsidian Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes). This'll mean adding weekly (and quarterly) templates that I'll be doing in tandem with the daily notes.

## Deliverables

1. Periodic note template for weekly notes on Sundays
2. Integration with #projects/personal/obsidian-tasks-workflow  to call out projects and integrate upcoming tasks with due dates (ðŸ˜·)

## Tasks

### Upfront

- [x] #task #projects/personal/obsidian-periodic-notes-setup Draft initial project reqs  [completion:: 2024-04-14]
- [x] #task #projects/personal/obsidian-periodic-notes-setup Hindsight write-up  [completion:: 2024-04-14]
### Other

```dataview
TASK
WHERE contains(tags, "#projects/personal/obsidian-periodic-notes-setup")
  AND file.name != "obsidian-periodic-notes-setup"
GROUP BY file.link
```

## Hindsight

Hot diggity damn, I am *loving* this new system. For the first time... probably *ever*, I have a good way to personally track deadlines and personal projects.

I do have a somewhat nagging to-do in trying to figure out how to render Dataview queries on the final published website, but there's been some solace in kicking that can into #projects/cgc/cgc-gatsby-template.
