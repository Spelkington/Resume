## Overview

As part of my partner's research, she'll be attending a biomedical conference in Sweden later this year... *and guess who's hitching a ride?!*

Thanks to a lack of recent travel and buildup of credit card miles, this should be a pretty cheap, straightforward trip. I'm super excited to travel abroad - going to Amsterdam in 2019 was an amazing experience, and I'm very lucky to have an intelligent, incredible partner â€” on whose coattails I can ride to incredible places ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ªðŸŽ‰

## Deliverables

1. Flight plans to Sweden
2. Booking hotels for off-trip periods (periods before and after the conference)
3. Travel prep - passport checks, etc etc.
