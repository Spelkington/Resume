The philosophy for this is kinda cool - the general idea is that, with an old computer, you can set up [digital appliances](https://tteck.github.io/Proxmox/) to automate things in your home. It's come in handy for quite a few things â€” if you have a spare computer that you don't use anymore (even just an old laptop), I'd highly recommend giving it a go!
