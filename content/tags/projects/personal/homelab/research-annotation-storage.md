## Overview

The #annotations  ongoing project has become pretty unmanageable pretty quickly - I have a bunch of scattered PDFs around. For legal reasons, I don't particularly want to add documents to this repository, so I'd like to instead store (authorized) copies of papers on my homelab server.

I'll likely be going through [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and [Calibre Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web) to manage these, with the added benefit that they can be sent to a Kindle for offline/outside reading â€” an important feature for summertime reading, especially in areas where it would be a bit inappropriate to bring my whole laptop.

## Deliverables

1. Calibre and Calibre Web builds
2. Clean system for uploading & organizing research to the backend server
3. Clean system for upload to external devices, such as a Kindle.
