## Overview

In a bit of an overlap of dayjob and CGC work, I'm working on spinning up a CGC instance of [Backstage](https://backstage.io) for business management. This has a benefit for both myself and others that work on CGC-flavor projects with me.

Additionally, this'll be hosted (initially) on the Allytron box â€” some extra #projects/personal/homelab work, for flavor!

## Deliverables

1. CGC instance of Backstage, connected to the organization, with tree structure in place
2. Portability - particularly, ability to port over to #dayjob work
3. One scaffold of a plugin
