## Overview

A few months ago, I played around with setting up a [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) environment for both work and CGC. It got backburner'd for a bit in favor of other projects, but with some upcoming free time, I'd like to get it started again

## Deliverables

1. Backstage environment documented, auth'd, and hooked to relevant GitHub repos
2. One scaffold for a custom plugin

## Tasks
