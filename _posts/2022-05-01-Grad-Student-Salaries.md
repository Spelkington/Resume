title: "How Broke Are Grad Students, Really?"

[UPDATE 12/11/2022] With all the recent talk about grad students in California's UC graduate system
unionizing, I was reminded of this small side-project I did for a friend of mine who
was looking for a more quantitative argument around higher graduate student pay. Now that
it's a hot topic (and grad students have shown they have the power to bring normal university
operations to a near-halt), I thought these insights may be of some interest!

and visualizations some point soon!
