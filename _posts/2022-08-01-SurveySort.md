In his 1951 seminal monograph "Social Choice and Individual Values", economist Kenneth Arrow
published a bunch of theorems related to the properties - and limitations - of voting systems.
As a lemma for these theorems he defines the idea of each person's sorted list of preferences
that they use to cast a vote. Sorted Lists? Oh, Kenny Arrow, you devious bastard - you snuck 
computer science into our social science!

[NOTE] This post is currently under construction. Here, I'll elaborate on an implementation
of sorting algorithms I did where a human being is the lambda function powering the underlying
rankings, as a sort of explanation bridge of Economics to Comp Sci types and of Comp Sci to
Economics types. Thanks for being patient - I'll get around to it soon!
