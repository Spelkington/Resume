title: "World of Foo: Wave Function Collapse for 3D Hex Grid Mapgen"
categories: [Software, TypeScript, Games, Roblox]

Now that my college days are done and my afternoons are free for me to waste away as I
please, I've fallen into the deep, depraved, demonic pasttime that has enthralled 20-somethings
for almost five decades: **Dungeons & Dragons**.

[NOTE] This page is currently under construction. The basic premise is that, as a side project,
I set up an implementation of [Wave Function Collapse](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/)
for hex grid terrain generation in Roblox. I'll publish an overview and code here once
I have the time to give the blog some good ol' TLC!
